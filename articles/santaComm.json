  "body": "Bathroom vandalizers beware! Santa has released 2022s list of commandments that will decide the years’ naughty and nice list. At the top of the list, among murder, rape, and j-walking is vandalism, and more specifically vandalism of bathrooms. That’s bad news for quite a few WSHS students who are repeat offenders of this. Luckily for those select few, Santa has also decided to open confessional booths in various cities. In his annual newsletter, he included some more details about this. In his newsletter, he wrote, “Confessional booths will be opening in a number of cities for anyone who feels they’ve been naughty. A bish-elf will listen to what your naughties and report to me. Please allow up to 12 months for a response.” This is huge news for naughty and nice folk alike because it means the playing field is leveled for everyone. Our analysts predict some pushback with the developments from all nice-folk as they don’t believe naughty folk should get that second chance. In the footnotes of Santa’s newsletter he writes, “Don’t write me letters about my new policies, I don’t care.” followed by his postal address. We folks at TheRootVegetable encourage you to check this list out to make sure you don’t accidentally commit one of Santa’s Sins!` ",
